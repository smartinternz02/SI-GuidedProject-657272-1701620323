✔ Now it's time to build our model. Let’s use the pre-trained model which is Xception, one of the convolution neural net (CNN) architecture which is considered as a very good model for Image classification.




✔ Deep understanding on the Xception model – Link is referred to in the prior knowledge section. Kindly refer to it before starting the model building part.
